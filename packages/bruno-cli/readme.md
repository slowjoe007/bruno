# bruno-cli

With Bruno CLI, you can now run your API collections with ease using simple command line commands.

This makes it easier to test your APIs in different environments, automate your testing process, and integrate your API tests with your continuous integration and deployment workflows.

## Installation

To install the Bruno CLI, use the node package manager of your choice, such as NPM:

```bash
npm install -g @usebruno/cli
```

## Getting started

Navigate to the directory where your API collection resides, and then run:

```bash
bru run
```

This command will run all the requests in your collection. You can also run a single request by specifying its filename:

```bash
bru run request.bru
```

Or run all requests in a collection's subfolder:

```bash
bru run folder
```

If you need to use an environment, you can specify it with the `--env` option:

```bash
bru run folder --env Local
```

If you need to collect the results of your API tests, you can specify the `--output` option:

```bash
bru run folder --output results.json
```

If you need to specify a custom CA certificate to validate the request peer, you can specify the `--cacert` option:

```bash
bru run request.bru --cacert myCustomCA.pem
```

If you need to run a set of requests that connect to peers with both publicly and privately signed certificates respectively, you can specify the `--extend-truststore` option in addition to the `--cacert` option:

```bash
bru run folder --cacert myCustomCA.pem --extend-truststore
```
